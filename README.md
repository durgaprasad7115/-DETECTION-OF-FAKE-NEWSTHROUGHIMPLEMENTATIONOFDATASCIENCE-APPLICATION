Detection of Fake News Through Implementation of Data Science Applications

This repository contains a project focused on the detection of fake news using data science techniques. The project applies machine learning algorithms to classify news articles as real or fake, leveraging natural language processing (NLP) for feature extraction and analysis.

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
Natural Language Processing: Implementation of NLP techniques such as tokenization, TF-IDF vectorization, and word embeddings.
Model Development: Training and evaluation of machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and more.
Accuracy and Optimization: Fine-tuning the models to achieve high accuracy and robustness in classification.
Visualization: Insights and analysis are presented through visual representations.


Tools and Technologies Used:
Python
Pandas, NumPy
Scikit-learn
NLTK, SpaCy
Matplotlib, Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook


Project Objectives:
Analyze patterns and features in text data to identify fake news.
Build an efficient and scalable model for news classification.
Demonstrate the application of data science techniques in real-world scenarios.
Feel free to explore the code, datasets, and insights presented in this repository. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
